# Movie Data Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a movies dataset using Python. The analysis includes data cleaning, summary statistics, visualizations, and insights derived from the dataset.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to practice data analysis skills by examining a dataset of movies. The analysis focuses on identifying trends, patterns, and relationships between key features such as genre, release year, ratings, and box office revenue.

### Key Features of the Project

- Import and inspect datasets using **pandas**
- Clean and preprocess data (handle missing values, duplicates, and data types)
- Perform summary statistics and basic aggregations
- Create visualizations using **matplotlib** and **seaborn**
- Derive insights from patterns in the data

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a CSV file containing information from TMDB such as:

- Movie titles
- Genre
- Release year
- IMDb ratings
- Box office revenue
